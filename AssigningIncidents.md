# Introduction #

Au-to-do users can assign incidents to themselves or other members of their team. This establishes clear ownership of the 'things to do' in the system. It also avoids the common problem of duplicate work, when two or more people start a task not knowing someone else is working on it already.

# Assigning an incident #

Assigning incidents is straightforward. If viewing the incident list view, select one or more incidents you'd like to assign by checking the box next to each incident. Then click **Assign**, which will open the assignment window. In the menu enter the email address of the person you'd like to become owner of the incidents and click **Assign**. This person is now owner of the incidents.

Assigning an incident within the single incident view works the same way, except only the currently visible incident is assigned.

# Removing an owner #

To remove the owner of an incident, assign the owner to the special value of _none_. This returns the incident to the set of unassigned incidents.

# Saving incidents in your Google Tasks list #

If you'd like incidents assigned to you to automatically appear in your Google Tasks list, visiting the settings page. In the **User Settings** section, click on the **Grant** button to allow Au-to-do to access your Google Tasks via the API. After granting approval, check the **Automatically add assigned incidents to my Google Tasks** checkbox, select a list where you'd like the items to appear, and click **Save**. Now when incidents are assigned to you, a new task will be created linking back to Au-to-do.
