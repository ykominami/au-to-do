# Introduction #

This page is a jumping-off point to discussion of the various features of Au-to-do.

# Labels #

Au-to-do allows users to manually assign labels for incidents, and uses the Prediction API to attempt to categorize incoming incidents with these labels. Learn more in UsingLabels.

# Assigning incidents #

Being able to assign incidents to a person provides clear ownership of individual tasks, and can help avoid inefficiencies (like duplicating work!) See how Au-to-do allows you to assign incidents in AssigningIncidents.

# Using the Chrome extension #

Au-to-do's source includes a Chrome extension that provides a:
  * Link to Au-to-do.
  * Counter indicating how many incidents have been assigned to you.
  * List of incidents assigned to you, and links directly to those incidents within Au-to-do.

To see how to configure the extension to point to your version of the app, and install it in Chrome, see UsingChromeExtension.
